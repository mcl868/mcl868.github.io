<p>
  My name is Thomas Maltesen.
  I am currently industrial PhD Student at Lundbeck.
  I am statistician by education from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.
  My PhD topic is causal inference and consider estimation methods for longitudinal data
  with monotone missingness.
  I have been for four month in Cardiff Wales to work on my research.
</p>

<p>
  I worked a research assitance at Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen.
  Whilst working as a research assistant at Section of Biostatistics at the University of Copenhagen,
  I worked on a number of projects including a multi states model of time to pregnancy,
  and on an with item response theory of working environment
  and I have in collaboration worked with a PhD-student on a project
  about disability of working for people who are mentally ill.
  I have written my employment history and my programmering skills in my
  <a href="https://mcl868.github.io/cv.html">curriculum vitae</a>.

  It is also possible to visit my

  profile.
</p>

<p>
  In 2015 I received my M.Sc. in statistical science from Department of Mathematical Sciences,
  University of Copenhagen.
  My master thesis with the title “Parameter estimation using a synthetic likelihood” was about
  using an intractable likelihood and Bayesian method to estimate the parameter
  of in a 2-dimensional stochastic differential equation model.
</p>

<p>
  I am a performance driven individual with strong analytical skills and have a positive, calm and quiet personality.
  I am organised about my work and always pay attention to details and focus on the quality of the work.
  My time studying, especially during my time in Wales, and in my current job, has given me ample experience
  of working in a multicultural situations and enjoy the challenges and pleasure of working with new people,
  from all over the world.
  I always want to improve my knowledge regarding statistical methods, and
  all kinds of software for both data manipulations and data analysis.
  I find it interesting to work with different kind of data for a practical purpose.
</p>

<p>
  My experience includes using R in my current work as well as and from my education at the University.
  I have over time developed packages to R that are accessible on my
  <a href="https://github.com/mcl868">GitHub</a> account.
  I find it interesting to learn different programmering language and for the moment I am
  going to learn to programme in Python and develop help page on my GitHub account.
  I have developed the packages in connection with my PhD to make the computational analysis easier, and
  I am able to work in SAS and write macros in both interactive- and in batch-versions.
  I have the ability to translate statistical analysis and conclusion to non-statisticians since
  I have experience by working with non-statisticians as well as statistical consulting
  during my time as research assistant at Section of Biostatistics at the University of Copenhagen.
